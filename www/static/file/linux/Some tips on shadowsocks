## proxychains
the problem that in terminal you cann't access socks
You can use [proxychains](https://github.com/rofl0r/proxychains-ng) to fix this problem. you can configure your proxy in `/etc/proxychains.conf`
```
[ProxyList]
socks5 127.0.0.1 your_port
```
Then you should only use the command just like
`sudo proxychains4 apt-get update`



## polipo
use polipo to turn socks proxy to httpproxy

```shell
$sudo apt-get install polipo
```
Edit the config file at `/etc/polipo/config`, and append the following two lines:
```shell
socksParentProxy = "localhost:1080"
socksProxyType = socks5
```
start and stop
```shell
$sudo service polipo stop
$sudo service polipo start
```
Now command as folows is alright:
```shell
$http_proxy=http://localhost:8123 curl ip.gs
```
Now we need to add the http_proxy setting into bashrc.If you are using zsh then edting ~/.zshrc and add the following:
```shell
export http_proxy=http://localhost:8123
export https_proxy=http://localhost:8123
```
At last you need to add the http_proxy and https_proxy and ip port settings to the system proxy setting.

## shadowsocks corrupt
try restart the service, or stop then start
```shell
$sudo service shadowsocks restart
```
